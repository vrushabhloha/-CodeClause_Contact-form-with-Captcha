- CAPTCHA verification: The form includes a CAPTCHA field to verify that the user is human and prevent automated submissions.
- Form validation: The form validates user input to ensure all required fields are filled correctly before submission.
- Email integration: Upon successful form submission, the project sends an email notification to the recipient with the user's details.
